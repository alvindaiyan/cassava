There are lots of morden commercial product are using Cassandra such as Netflix, Spotify and Coursera. As Cassandra became more and more popular, the eco-system has grow up very quickly such as a whole distributed computing solution using Cassandra and Hadoop. 

# Why Cassava?

Cassandra is one of the most famouse and powerful NoSql database. However, when I first using Cassandra, the complicated configuration file, firewall and so on make me almost give up. Therefore, I decided to developed a framework to simplify the use of Apache Cassandra.

As today, there are lots of popular frameworks to cassandra such as spring-cassandra. When you looked at my design, you will found there are lots of similarity. But, in Cassava, everything are simplified. When you are playing with Cassava, you suppose to quickly start a cassandra project without knowing any CQL, Cassandra Configuration even any NoSql database knowledge. This project is to help people from relational database world or those who are newbie to this IT world and looking some simple DB solution.
